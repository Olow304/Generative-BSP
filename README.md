Read sections 3.1 and 3.2 of Procedural Content Generation in Games (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. You will then implement the BSP-based dungeon generation algorithm described on pg. 25. Your program should ultimately output a visual depiction of your generated dungeons, either with simple text-based output or potentially with visual graphics using open frameworks (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (C++) or python graphics (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

You can work with a partner if you wish, and your solution can be written in either C++ or python. Your submission should include both the source code used to implement your solution and a report containing the following:

* A plain English description of the problem you are solving and your approach to solving the problem
* Screenshots of output for 3 different runs of your program (showing 3 different generated dungeons)
* A reflection on your implementation process. Your reflection should at least address the following issues: 1) What if any implementation difficulties did you face? 2) Were there any significant design decisions that you made to make? 3) If you had to implement this program again, is there anything that you would do differently?
* Suggestions of 3 other possible applications of quadtrees or other kinds of trees for generative purposes. You can either come up with suggestions on your own or do some research to see what already-existing work has been done, but you must cite sources if you describe work done by other people.
* If you work with a partner, you must also describe how labor was divided and who was responsible for what.
* Your grade will be based 50% on your code and 50% on the report.
